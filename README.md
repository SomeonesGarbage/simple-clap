**Simple python code used to detect claps (or any other loud sound)**
# instructions
  1. Download python (latest version recomended)
  2. Install numpy and sounddevice using pip (ex. pip install numpy)
  3. Download clap.py from this repo
  4. Change the **CLAP_THRESHOLD** to what you want. (For me works 27)
